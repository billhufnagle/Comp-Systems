// To run these two programs, open two separate terminal windows
//then, use cd to change to the directory of these two files, most likely
//somewhere in your downloads folder.
//then, compile the three files, assuming you have the correct classpaths for java
//this will simply be javac serverbitcoin.java, then press enter
//and javac clientbitcoin.java, as well as javac Bitcoinheader.java, warnings may arrise but as long as it doesn't
// say error you are all set. Then in one of the terminal windows
//** type java serverbitcoin then press enter and in the other
// type java clientbitcoin then press enter, make sure to do it in this order
//the clientbitcoin should start counting by 100,000s, this means its working
//it will end and print out 2 large hexadecimal numbers, the top being the hash\
// of the header, the bottom being the target
//at which point the serverbitcoin terminal will print out yes if it was accepted
//if that is printed then the puzzle was correctly solved and verified
//that is the end of the program, it can be rerun by following the steps starting
//at the double asterisk(**)
//much of this code came from the geeks for geeks website provided in the
//assignment, modified to fit this purpose
